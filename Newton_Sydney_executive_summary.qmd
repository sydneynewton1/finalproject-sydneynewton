The NFL is a league with many different types of positions that produce many different types of stats. The goal of this final project was to analyze offensive player stats in the NFL, to determine how the stats vary by position, how they have changed over the last few years, and which variables have the highest correlation with each other. NFL offensive stats can be split into three categories: receiving, passing, and rushing. 

In regards to receiving, it is important to consider two positions: tight ends and wide receivers. Tight ends had a higher proportion of athletes with a lower amount of receiving yards than wide receivers. However, both had a right skew distribution, which means that each position had several athletes performing above average. The distribution of average receiving yards has remained consistent from 2019-2022, although it increases in 2020. Unlike wide receivers, the average receiving yards for tight ends remained extremely steady over the last 4 seasons. Both positions had outliers in specific seasons, which corresponded to an extremely high performance of an athlete during a game. When looking at both positions, the only variables that had a correlation to one another were receiving yards and receiving long, with a 84% relation to one another.

Next, passing is a stat centered around the quarterback position. When analyzing passing yards across the past few years, it was discovered that the average passing yards and the range of passing yards has varied a decent amount over the past four years. That said, it hasn't changed drastically. Similar to receiving, there 3 outliers in when looking at average passing yards for certain seasons, which correlated to an extremely impressive performance by a Quarterback in a game. Passing yards had the highest correlation with passing attempts and pass completions â€” two variables that also had high relation to one another. All three of these variables had around 98% correlations with one another. These variables had a higher relation to one another than any of the other 10 passing variables. 

Additionally, it was important to examine rushing. Similar to receiving, rushing considers two positions: running backs and full backs. In general, most rushing yards tend to be in the 0-25, when you are looking at players in each game and average yards of each player. However, there are outliers, which are the highest performing running backs. When looking at both positions, Running Backs had on average more yards than Full Backs. But when looking across years, rushing has remained very consistently used. Additionally, rushing yards did not have a high relation to many of the variables, except for the correlation with rush attempts and rush yards before contact. Rush Yards before contact and rushing yards had the highest correlation with one another, although it was only 3% higher than the other two variables. The consistency across years in rushing yards and low correlation with many of the rushing variables points to the fact that the talent of running backs and fullbacks has remained consistent over the past 4 years.

Finally, when looking at how common each position was, the positions with multiple players on the field had higher frequencies. Additionally, the frequency of each position has remained steady from 2019-2022. 

Overall, the analysis revealed that while individual player performances and passing yards varied moderately over the past four years, most offensive statistics and player positioning remained relatively constant. Receiving yards for both tight ends and wide receivers were consistent, with a right-skewed distribution and outliers corresponding to exceptional performance. Rushing yards also remained consistent, with running backs accumulating more yards on average than fullbacks. Passing yards varied the most, although not significantly. Additionally, the frequency of each position remained stable throughout the examined period. These findings suggest a relatively stable landscape in NFL offensive statistics and player usage despite potential fluctuations in individual performances.
