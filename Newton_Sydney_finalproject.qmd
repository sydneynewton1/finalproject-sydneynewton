# Introduction
Since I was a little kid, I have been a huge fan of the Kansas City Chiefs football team. I've watched the team go through several different players, and have many up and down seasons. I have also followed the nfl for several years, so I chose an nfl centered dataset.

When looking at the player and team datasets, my main goal is analyzing nfl stats at both a player level. I have seen many different types of players, so I am interested what the stats looks like of each position, and how the stats have changed over the last 5 years. I am interested in analyzing how player stats have changed over the last few years, and how stats contribute to a team's performance. 



# Data Overview & Quality

```{r echo = FALSE}
#clean data
nfloffensiveplayers_new <- nfloffensiveplayers |>
  mutate(year = substr(game_id, 1, 4)) |>
  filter(position == "WR" | position == "TE" | position == "QB" | position == "RB" | position == "T" | position == "P" | position == "C" | position == "K"| position == "FB" | position == "G") |>
  select(player, position, year, team, rec, rec_yds, rec_td, rec_long, rec_yds_bonus, pass_cmp, pass_att, pass_yds, pass_int, pass_sacked, pass_sacked_yds, pass_long, pass_rating, pass_target_yds, pass_poor_throws, pass_blitzed, pass_hurried, rush_att, rush_yds, rush_td, rush_long, rush_yac, rush_broken_tackles, rush_scrambles, rush_yds_before_contact, targets, fumbles_lost)

# Save clean data to CSV
write.csv(nfloffensiveplayers_new, "data/nfloffensiveplayers_new.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

I am using a data set from kaggle.com that shown the offensive stats for every offensive player in every game in the NFL from 2019-2022. The data set has 69 columns that cover a variety of stats for different positions, and 19,973 observations. Each observation correlates with one players stats during one NFL game within those 4 years. There are both categorical and numerical variables, although the data set has several more numerical variables.  

There was missingness issues for only one variable, which was "Vegas Favorite". It had 46 missing variables. This is the variable that says if the player was considered a favorite in the stats for betting, so it's not entirely surprising that some of the variables are missing. I don't believe the issues in this one variable will impact the analysis.

There was a little bit of cleaning that had to go into this data set. There were a few defensive players included in the datatset, so I removed those. I also removed a few columns that were not necessary to my data exploration, such as "player_id", "team_abbr", and a few stats that did not relate to offensive player performance. Lastly, I also mutated the game id column so it just showed the year of the game, rather than the long number id.

# Explorations

## Recieving Analysis

First, I want to look at receiving. 

### Frequency of Recieving Yards

To begin, I am curious about what the distribution looks like of receiving yards. There are two positions that receive: wide receivers and tight ends. I want to look at the distribution for the overall stats.

```{r echo = FALSE}
rec_yds_frequency <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "TE" | position == "WR") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rec_yds)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.4, color="lightblue", fill="skyblue") +
    labs(title = "Frequency of Amount of Receiving Yards Per Game", x = "Receiving Yards (yds)")

rec_yds_frequency

ggsave("plots/rec_yds_frequency.png", rec_yds_frequency, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![The Distribution of Overall Receiver Yards per Game for Both Tight Ends and Wide Receivers](plot/rec_yds_frequency.png){#fig-plot-1}

@fig-plot-1 shows that majority of recieving yards lie in the 0-50 range. However, the graph has a right skew, and there are outliers which are players with above 150+ yards in a game.

Next, I want to look at the distribution for overalls stats by position.


```{r echo = FALSE}
rec_yds_position_frequency <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "WR" | position == "TE") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rec_yds, color=position, fill=position)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
    labs(title = "Frequency of Receiving Yards By Position", x = "Receiving Yards (yds)")

rec_yds_position_frequency

ggsave("plots/rec_yds_position_frequency.png", rec_yds_position_frequency, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![The Distribution of Overall Receiver Yards per Game for Tight Ends vs Wide Receivers](plot/rec_yds_position_frequency.png){#fig-plot-2}

@fig-plot-2 reveals that Tight Ends have lower overall receiving stats than wide receivers. This is not surprising, since tight ends have two jobs: blocking and receiving. Not all tight ends catch, but all wide receivers catch. This difference in position nature explains the difference in the range of receiving yards between the two positions.

### Wide Reciever Receiving Yards Across Years

Next, I want to explore how the receiving yards stats have changed across years. Since tight ends and wide receivers are fairly different positions, I am going to explore the position separately. First, I am going to look at wide receivers.

```{r echo = FALSE}
recyds_nfloffensiveplayers_new <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "WR") |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(mean_rec_yds = mean(rec_yds))

kable(recyds_nfloffensiveplayers_new)
```

The receiving yards by year of wide receivers shows a unique trend. The average yards went up in 2020, but then when down in 2021 and 2022. However, the average has not changed significantly, only going down a total of an average of 2 yards. This shows that the emphasis on throwing in the NFL has remained fairly consistent, and that the talent in the NFL has also stayed consistent. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
wide_rec_year <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "WR") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rec_yds, fill=year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Wide Reciever Recieving Yards by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Recieving Yards", fill="Year")
wide_rec_year

ggsave("plots/wide_rec_year.png", wide_rec_year, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![The Distribution of Receiving Yards in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 for Wide Receivers](plot/wide_rec_year.png){#fig-plot-3}

The range in @fig-plot-3 year by year is also fairly consistent. There seem to be many outliers each year, and there is one extreme outliers in 2020 and 2022.

### Top Wide Receivers

Now, I am interested in looking at which players these 2 outliers are for.

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfloffensiveplayers_new_top5 <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(year == "2020" & position == "WR") |>
  select(player, position, year, team, rec_yds) |>
  arrange(desc(rec_yds)) |>
  slice(1:2)

kable(nfloffensiveplayers_new_top5)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfloffensiveplayers_new_top5 <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(year == "2022" & position == "WR") |>
  select(player, position, year, team, rec_yds) |>
  arrange(desc(rec_yds)) |>
  slice(1:2)

kable(nfloffensiveplayers_new_top5)
```

After looking into it more, I found that the outlier in 2020 was Tyreek Hill and the outlier in 2022 was Ja'Marr Chase.

After exploring further, I learned that Tyreek Hill got 269 receiving yards while he played for the Kansas City Chiefs in a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I personally remember watching this game, and I recalled it as soon as I saw the outlier, which is why I wanted to explore further. Ja'Marr Chase got 266 receiving yards for the Cincinnati Bengals in a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Both of these games set records, with Hill holding the 14th most receiving yards in a single game of all time and Chase holding the 16th most. Taking these stats into consideration, it makes sense that the outliers look so significant in the distribution.

### Tight End Receiving Yards Across Years

Now that I have explored the recieving yards of wide receivers from 2019 to 2022, I am interested in exploring the change in receiving yards of tight ends across years.

```{r echo = FALSE}
recydste_nfloffensiveplayers_new <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "TE") |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(mean_rec_yds = mean(rec_yds))

kable(recydste_nfloffensiveplayers_new)
```

The average receiving stats of tight ends each year is more consistent than wide receivers, remaining around 17 each year, although it was higher in 2019.

```{r echo = FALSE}
tight_end_year <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "TE") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rec_yds, fill=year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Tight End Recieving Yards by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Recieving Yards", fill= "Year")

tight_end_year

ggsave("plots/tight_end_year.png", tight_end_year, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![The Distribution of Receiving Yards by for 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 for Tight Ends](plot/tight_end_year.png){#fig-plot-4}

When looking at @fig-plot-4, there are similar ranges across years. There also seems to be several outliers each year. However, 2020 and 2021 have higher outliers than either of the other years.

### Top Tight Ends

Similar to Wider Receivers, I am curious to see which tight ends the outliers are.

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfloffensiveplayers_new_top5 <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(year == "2020" & position == "TE") |>
  select(player, position, year, team, rec_yds) |>
  arrange(desc(rec_yds)) |>
  slice(1:5)

kable(nfloffensiveplayers_new_top5)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfloffensiveplayers_new_top5 <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(year == "2021" & position == "TE") |>
  select(player, position, year, team, rec_yds) |>
  arrange(desc(rec_yds)) |>
  slice(1:5)

kable(nfloffensiveplayers_new_top5)
```

Unlike Wide Receivers, there isn't any extreme outliers, but there are several that are significantly above average. The average receiving yards per tight end is 17-18, yet there are receivers with above 150 yards. When looking at the top 5 for the two outlier years, there are several players with high numbers, such as Travis Kelce and George Kittle.

```{r echo = FALSE}
top_5_players <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "TE") |>
  group_by(player) |>
  summarise(avg_rec_yds = mean(rec_yds)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_rec_yds)) |>
  head(5)

kable(top_5_players)
```

When looking at the top tight ends with the best overall receiving yards, the data is consistent with the outliers in 2020 and 2021. Travis Kelce, Darren Waller, George Kittle, and Kyle Pitts have the highest average receiving yards across all games, so it makes sense those 4 make up many of the outliers. 

It also makes sense that tight ends have a wider range of receiving yards that wide receivers since the position has two functions, as mentioned earlier. Since not all tight ends receive, it creates a high disparity between the average receiving yards among all tight ends and the average recieving yards among the top tight ends. 

### Tight Ends vs. Wide Receivers

Now that we have explored the receiving yards across years among tight ends and wide receivers individually, I am interested in comparing them during each year.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
nfl_filtered <- nfloffensiveplayers_new[nfloffensiveplayers_new$position %in% c("WR", "TE"),]

# Count total rec_yds for each player
rec_yds_count <- nfl_filtered |>
  group_by(position, year) |>
  summarise(total_rec_yds = sum(rec_yds)) |>
  ungroup()

# Create a side-by-side bar graph
total_rec_yds_position <- rec_yds_count |>
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = total_rec_yds, fill = position)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Total Receiving Yards by Year and Position", x = "Year", y = "Total Receiving Yards", fill="Position") +
  theme_minimal()
total_rec_yds_position

ggsave("plots/total_rec_yds_position.png", total_rec_yds_position, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A side-by-side comparison of the total receiving yards for Tight Ends versus Wide Receivers for each year in the data](plot/total_rec_yds_position.png){#fig-plot-5}

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
nfl_filtered <- nfloffensiveplayers_new[nfloffensiveplayers_new$position %in% c("WR", "TE"),]

# Count total rec_yds for each player
rec_yds_count <- nfl_filtered |>
  group_by(position, year) |>
  summarise(avg_rec_yds = mean(rec_yds)) |>
  ungroup()

# Create a side-by-side bar graph
avg_rec_yds_position <- rec_yds_count |>
ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_rec_yds, fill = position)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Receiving Yards by Year and Position", x = "Year", y = "Average Receiving Yards", fill="Position") +
  theme_minimal()

avg_rec_yds_position

ggsave("plots/avg_rec_yds_position.png", avg_rec_yds_position, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A side-by-side comparison of the average receiving yards individual Tight Ends versus Wide Receivers across 4 years](plot/avg_rec_yds_position.png){#fig-plot-6}

@fig-plot-5 and @fig-plot-6 make it clear that wide receivers have a much higher amount of receiving yards than tight ends, both total and average. Neither of these graphs is surprising.

First, there are 3 wide recievers on a team, compared to 1 tight end on a team. This explains why the total receiving yards is higher. Second, since the positions functions differently, it is understandable why the average receiving yards is higher for wide receivers.

### Recieving Yards vs Other Recieving Variables

```{r echo = FALSE}
rec_yds_cor <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "WR" | position == "TE") |>
  select(rec_yds, rec_td, rec_long, rec_yds_bonus) |>
  cor() |>
  ggcorrplot() +
  labs(title="Correlation Plot for Statistics Relating to Receiving")
rec_yds_cor

ggsave("plots/rec_yds_cor.png", rec_yds_cor, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A heatmap showing the relationship between 4 receiving variables: receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, receiving yards bonuses, and receiving longs](plot/rec_yds_cor.png){#fig-plot-7}

When looking at the variables in @fig-plot-7, none of them seem to have an extremely high correlation with one another. The only variables that look to have a somewhat high relation to the other is receiving yards and receiving long.

### Recieving Yards vs Other Recieving Variables

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
correlation_rec <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "WR" | position == "TE") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rec_yds, y = rec_long)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "The Correlation Between Receiving Yards and Receiving Long",
       x = "Receiving Yards",
       y = "Receiving Long")
correlation_rec

ggsave("plots/correlation_rec.png", correlation_rec, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A correlation plot showing the relationship between receiving yards and receiving long](plot/correlation_rec.png){#fig-plot-8}

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfl_rec <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
   filter(position == "WR" | position == "TE") |>
  select(rec_yds, rec_long) |>
  cor()
kable(nfl_rec)
```

@fig-plot-6 shows a heavy relation between the two variables, which is confirmed by the table that shows an 84% correlation between receiving yards and receiving long. This correlation makes sense, since the "receiving long" variable means that the receiving was running a long route when they caught the call. The longer the route, the more yards they in turn get, causing more receiving yards. 

## Passing Analysis

Next, I want to examine passing.

### Passing Yards Across Years

First, I am going to analyze the passing yards across years.

```{r echo = FALSE}
passyds_nfloffensiveplayers_new <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "QB") |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(mean_pass_yds = mean(pass_yds))
kable(passyds_nfloffensiveplayers_new)
```

The average passing yards in the nfl is interesting. You have to pass a ball to recieve it, so I am surprised that there is a higher range of differences year by year in passing than in recieving. There was a downward trend in average recieving yards from 2019 to 2021, but then it went back up. I think the disaparity between throwing and recieving could be explained by the fact that there is only one quarterback on an nfl team, compared to multiple recievers.

```{r echo = FALSE}
pass_yds_year <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "QB") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = pass_yds, fill=year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Passsing Yards by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Passing Yards", fill= "Year")
pass_yds_year

ggsave("plots/pass_yds_year.png", pass_yds_year, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A side-by-side comparison of the overall passing yards for quarterbacks across 4 years](plot/pass_yds_year.png){#fig-plot-9}

@fig-plot-9 shows that the range of passing yards is pretty consistent, similar to the averages, althought there is a small downward trend. There are almost now outliers, except for 1 extreme outlier in 2019 and 2 extreme outliers in 2021.

### Top Quarterbacks

Now, I am interested in exploring what the who the 3 quarterback outliers are.

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfloffensiveplayers_new_2 <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(year == "2019" & position == "QB") |>
  select(player, position, year, team, pass_yds) |>
  arrange(desc(pass_yds)) |>
  slice(1:5)
kable(nfloffensiveplayers_new_2)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfloffensiveplayers_new_1 <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(year == "2021" & position == "QB") |>
  select(player, position, year, team, pass_yds) |>
  arrange(desc(pass_yds)) |>
  slice(1:5)
kable(nfloffensiveplayers_new_1)
```

The outlier in 2019 was Jared Goff when he played for the Los Angeles Rams. The outliers in 2021 were Joe Burrow when he played for the Cinncinati Bengals and Ben Roethlisberger when he played for the Pittsburg Steelers. These are outliers since they are all 50+ yards above the person below them. 

Similar to the Wide Reciever stats, these games all set records. Burrows game was the 4th most passing yards of all time in an nfl game, Roethlisberger's was the 5th most, and Goff's was the 10th most. These records help explain why the outliers seem so significant.

### Correlation Between Passing Yards and Other Passing Variables

Now that we have analyzed passing yards, I am interested in analyzing the relationship between passing yards and the other variables related to passing: pass completions, pass attempts, pass interceptions, passes sacked, and pass rating.

```{r echo = FALSE}
pass_cor <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "QB") |>
  select(pass_cmp, pass_yds, pass_att, pass_int, pass_sacked, pass_rating, pass_target_yds, pass_poor_throws, pass_blitzed, pass_hurried) |>
  cor() |>
  ggcorrplot() +
  labs(title="Correlation Plot for Statistics Relating to Passing")

pass_cor

ggsave("plots/pass_cor.png", pass_cor, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A heatmap showing the correlation between 10 different variables related to passing: the part of football being explored](plot/pass_cor.png){#fig-plot-10}

@fig-plot-10 shows that the three variables with the highest correlations to each other are pass completions, pass yards, and pass attempts. I am interested in further exploring relationship with those 3 variables.

### Pass Completions vs. Pass Yards vs. Pass Attempts

First, I want to further explore the correlation between passing yards, pass completions, and pass attempts for quarterbacks. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
pass_var_core <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  select(pass_cmp, pass_att, pass_yds) |>
  ggpairs(aes(alpha = 0.2)) +
  labs(title="The Correlation Between Pass Completions, Pass Attempts, and Pass Yards", x="Yards", y="Frequency")

pass_var_core

ggsave("plots/pass_var_core.png", pass_var_core, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A representation of the visual and numeric correlation between three variables: passing yards, passing attempts, and pass completions](plot/pass_var_core.png){#fig-plot-11}

@fig-plot-11 explores the relationship between all 3 at the same time. The variables all have high correlations with each other and demonstrates a positive correlation in the graphs. 

Althought they are all similar, pass completions and pass attempts have a slightly higher correlation than the other variables. Pass yards and pass completions have the second highest correlation, and pass yards and pass attempts have the lowest correlation. 

## Rushing Analysis 

Finally, I am going to explore rushing in this dataset.

### Distribution of Rushing Yards
There are three different positions that can rush the ball: running backs, and full backs. To start, I want to examine the distribution or rushing yards of both positions.

```{r echo = FALSE}
rush_yds_dist <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB" | position == "FB") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rush_yds)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue", bins = 40) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Rush Yards Per Game", x = "Rush Yards", y = "Frequency")

rush_yds_dist

ggsave("plots/rush_yds_dist.png", rush_yds_dist, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A histrogram showing the frequency of rush yards per game for both Running Backs and Full Back](plot/rush_yds_dist.png){#fig-plot-12}

```{r echo = FALSE}
rush_yds_player_dist <-nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB" | position == "FB") |>
  group_by(player) |>
  summarise(avg_rush_yds = mean(rush_yds)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = avg_rush_yds)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "blue", bins = 30) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Average Rush Yards Per Player", x = "Rush Yards", y = "Frequency")

rush_yds_player_dist

ggsave("plots/rush_yds_player_dist.png", rush_yds_player_dist, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A histrogram showing the frequency of average rush yards per player for both Running Backs and Full Back](plot/rush_yds_player_dist.png){#fig-plot-13}

@fig-plot-12 shows the distribution of rushing yards per game and @fig-plot-13 shows the rushing yards per player. Both @fig-plot-12 and @fig-plot-13 have similar overall distributions. They are both right skew and unimodel. However, the frequency of the average rushing yards is lower than total yards, althought that is to be expected.

I am personally not surprised by the right skew. Rushing is generally not meant to gain a lot of yards, so it makes send that both the majority of  rushing yards per game per and the average rushing yards per player is in the 0-25 range. However, some plays end up gaining a large number of rushing yards, which explains the right skew and the outliers on both graphs. There is one outlier in average yards, which will be explored below in the "Top Running Backs" section.p;


### Distribution of Rushing Yards by Position

Next, I want to compare the distribution of rushing yards among the 2 positions.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
rec_yds_count <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB" | position == "FB") |>
  group_by(position, year) |>
  summarise(mean_rush_yds = mean(rush_yds)) |>
  ungroup()

# Create a side-by-side bar graph
avg_rushyds_pos <- rec_yds_count |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_rush_yds, fill = position)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Average Rushing Yards by Year and Position", x = "Year", y = "Average Rushing Yards", fill="Position") +
  theme_minimal()
avg_rushyds_pos

ggsave("plots/avg_rushyds_pos.png", avg_rushyds_pos, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A side-by-side comparison of the average rushing yards across four years for two positions: running backs and full backs](plot/avg_rushyds_pos.png){#fig-plot-14}

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
rec_yds_count <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB" | position == "FB") |>
  group_by(position, year) |>
  summarise(total_rush_yds = sum(rush_yds)) |>
  ungroup()

# Create a side-by-side bar graph
tot_rushyds_pos <- rec_yds_count |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = total_rush_yds, fill = position)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    labs(title = "Total Rushing Yards by Year and Position", x = "Year", y = "Total Rushing Yards", fill="Position") +
  theme_minimal()
tot_rushyds_pos

ggsave("plots/tot_rushyds_pos.png", tot_rushyds_pos, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A side-by-side comparison between running backs and full backs of the total rushing yards across four seasona](plot/tot_rushyds_pos.png){#fig-plot-15}

@fig-plot-14 and @fig-plot-15 produce consistent results. In both graphs, running backs have significantly higher rushing yards than fullbacks. At first, these results surprised me since running backs and full backs are virtually the same position. However, after analyzing it more and looking at the dataset, I realized that teams have siginificantly more running backs than fullbacks and they use running backs more. This explains the difference in both total yards and average yards. 

### Analysis of Rushing Yards by Year

Now that we have analyzed the distribution of rushing yards, I want to examine how rushing yards have changed over the last 5 years. Since running backs and fullbacks are extremely similar positions, I am going to summarize both positions for this analysis.

```{r echo = FALSE}
rushyds_nfloffensiveplayers_new <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB" | position == "FB") |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(mean_rush_yds = mean(rush_yds))
kable(rushyds_nfloffensiveplayers_new)
```

There is a extremely high consistency when it comes to rushing yards in the nfl. It remained around 33.7 average yards across the 4 years, never differentiating by more than a yard. The average yards are also lower than recieving and passing, which makes sense since rushing generally does not lead to as many yard gains as recieving does.

```{r echo = FALSE}
rush_yds_year <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB" | position == "FB") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = rush_yds, fill=year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Rushing Yards by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Recieving Yards", fill= "Year")
rush_yds_year

ggsave("plots/rush_yds_year.png", rush_yds_year, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![An analysis of the change in the range of receiving yards for running backs and full backs from 2019-2022](plot/rush_yds_year.png){#fig-plot-16}

@fig-plot-16 shows a similar range among all four years. However, there are many outliers in each year. 2021 has 2 outliers that are higher than any other year. 

### Top Running Backs

Similar to the other positions, I am interested in seeing which running backs performed high enough to be the outliers. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfl_top <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(year == "2021" & position == "RB") |>
  select(player, position, year, team, rush_yds) |>
  arrange(desc(rush_yds)) |>
  slice(1:5)
kable(nfl_top)
```

Jonathan Taylor had 253 yards in a single game while playing for the Indianapolis Colts, and Derrick Henry had 250 yards while playing for the Tennesee Titans. This is over 200 above the average and over 50 above the other outliers, which explains why it stands out in the graph. 

Unsurpringsly, these games also set records in the nfl. Taylor had the 9th most rushign yards in an individual game in nfl history, and Henry had the 13th. It is interesting to compare the stand-out outliers to nfl records, since it puts into perspective how extreme the outliers truly are.

```{r echo = FALSE}
top_rb <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB") |>
  group_by(player) |>
  summarise(avg_rush_yds = mean(rush_yds)) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_rush_yds)) |>
  head(2)

kable(top_rb )
```
These result are consistent with the outliers, since Jonathon Taylor and Derrick Henry not only had the two highest performing games, but were also the overall top 2 highest performing running backs in the past 5 years.

### Rush Yards vs. Other Rush Variables


```{r echo = FALSE}
rushyds_cor <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB") |>
  select(rush_yds, rush_att, rush_td, rush_long, rush_scrambles, rush_yds_before_contact, rush_yac, rush_broken_tackles) |>
  cor() |>
  ggcorrplot()+
  labs(title="Correlation Plot for Statistics Relating to Rushing")
rushyds_cor

ggsave("plots/rushyds_cor.png", rushyds_cor, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A heatmap demonstrating the correlation between 8 different variables that are in relation to rushing](plot/rushyds_cor.png){#fig-plot-17}

@fig-plot-17 shows that unlike the passing variables, the rushing variables don't have as heavy of a correlation with each other. The only variables that seem to have somewhat of a heavy correlation is rushing yards and rushing attempts, and then rushing yards and rushing yards before contact.

### Rush Attempts vs. Rush Yards

Now, I want to further explore the correlation between rushing yards and rush attempts for running backs. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
rush_correlation_plot <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rush_att, y = rush_yds)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "The Correlation Between Rush Attempts and Rush Yards",
       x = "Rushing Attempts",
       y = "Rushing Yards")
rush_correlation_plot

ggsave("plots/rush_correlation_plot.png", rush_correlation_plot, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A scatterplot showing the positive, linear relationship between two variables: Rushing Attempts and Rushing Yards](plot/rush_correlation_plot.png){#fig-plot-18}

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfl_rb <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
   filter(position == "RB") |>
  select(rush_att, rush_yds) |>
  cor()
kable(nfl_rb)
```

@fig-plot-18 showing a high correlation between rushing yards and rushing attempts, which is an 87.5% correlation according to the table. This is consistent with the correlation shown by the heat map. It also makes sense that these two variables are related. The more attempts someone has at rushing, the more yards they will get. That said, it also makes sense that it is not extremely close to 100%, since an attempt doesn't guarantee that the running back will gain yards on the play.

### Rush Yards vs. Rush Yards Before Contact

Next, I want to explore the relationship between rush yards and rush yards before contact.

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
nfl_rushyds_comparison <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  filter(position == "RB") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = rush_att, y = rush_yds_before_contact)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "The Relationship between Rushing Yards and Rushing Yards Before Contact",
       x = "Rushing Yards",
       y = "Rushing Yards Before Contact")
nfl_rushyds_comparison

ggsave("plots/nfl_rushyds_comparison.png", nfl_rushyds_comparison, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A scatterplot demonstrating a positive correlation between between Rushing Yards Before Contact and Rushing Yards](plot/nfl_rushyds_comparison.png){#fig-plot-19}

```{r echo = FALSE}
nfl_rushyds <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
   filter(position == "RB") |>
  select(rush_yds, rush_yds_before_contact) |>
  cor()
kable(nfl_rushyds)
```

@fig-plot-19 demonstrates that there is also a heavy correlation between these two variables, at 90%. However, I am surpised the correlation is not even higher. One of the variables represents the total rush yards in a game, and the other variable represents the total rush yards in a game before the player is hit. Normally, when the player gets hit, it means the play is over. Because of this, I am surprised the correlation is not closer to 100%.

## Overall Analysis

Now that we have explored rushing, passing, and recieving more deeply, I am interested in analyzing the dataset as a whole. 

### Frequency of Positions

First, I am interested in looking at how common each position is in the dataset.

```{r echo = FALSE}
position_pie_chart <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |> 
  filter(position == "QB" | position == "RB" | position == "TE" | position == "WR" | position == "FB" | position == "HB") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = "", fill = position)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "Offensive Scoring Positions Distribution", x = NULL, y = NULL)

position_pie_chart

ggsave("plots/position_pie_chart.png", position_pie_chart, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A pie chart showing the distributions of the offensive positions that help their NFL team score](plot/position_pie_chart.png){#fig-plot-20}

@fig-plot-20 highlights that Wide Recievers are the most common offensive position in the dataset, which makes sense since there are more wide recievers on the feild at a time than the other positions. Quarterback was the least common positions, which is also not surprising since teams normally only have 1 backup quarterback, and their main "franchise" quarterback remains on the field at all times. This is unlike the other positions where the players consistently switch out, so they need more backups.

I was surprised that there was more tight ends in the dataset than running backs. I see more running backs switch out than tight ends when I'm watching football, so I always assumed there would be more backup RBs than TEs. However, this assumption is untrue as shown by the pie chart.


```{r echo = FALSE}
position_pie_chart_2 <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |> 
  filter(position == "C" | position == "T" | position == "G") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = "", fill = position)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(title = "Offensive Line Position Distribution", x = NULL, y = NULL)

position_pie_chart_2

ggsave("plots/position_pie_chart_2.png", position_pie_chart_2, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A pie chart showing the distributions of the offensive positions in the offensive line, or O-line](plot/position_pie_chart_2.png){#fig-plot-21}

In @fig-plot-21, there are more tackles than centers, which makes sense since there are more tackles on the field than centers at a time. It is surprising that there are more tackles than guards since both positions have 2 on the field at a time. I would assume it's because tackles get more easily injured since they are on the ends of the offensive line.

### Frequency of Positions by Year

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Count players by position and year
nfl_count <- nfloffensiveplayers_new |>
  group_by(position, year) |>
  summarize(n = n())

# Create facet wrap bar graph
freq_pos_year <- nfl_count |>
  ggplot(aes(x = position, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  labs(title = "Number of Players by Position and Year",
       x = "Position",
       y = "Number of Players")

freq_pos_year

ggsave("plots/freq_pos_year.png", freq_pos_year, width = 6, height = 6)
```
![A side-by-side comparison of the number of players for each positions for each in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022](plot/freq_pos_year.png){#fig-plot-22}

@fig-plot-22 shows that of the positions remained fairly consistent throughout each year, except for the decrease in 2022. This disparity can be explained by the fact that this dataset was created in 2022, so they likely missed players that were recruited towards the end of the year.


# Conclusion

Throught this exploration, I looked at rushing, receiving, and passing. I found that the average years of each has remained consistent across the last four years, although passing yards has varied the most. It was surprisinging that passing yards varied more than receiving yards, since the two should in theory have a high correlation with one another. Each of the variables also had outliers. When these outliers were explored further, it was found that they were correlated to individual players that set NFL records with those numbers. Two of the variables, receiving and rushing, centered around two different position. In both cases, one position out performed the other, althought that was for different reasons. Wide recievers had higher receiving stats than tight ends since not all tight ends receive, and running backs had higher rushing stats than full backs since running backs are used more. I had expected the different in receiving yards since I follow the tight end position, but I did not expect the difference in rushing yards. 

When looking at the three categories, there were high correlations between variables in each one. Receiving yards was heavily correlated with receiving long, and rushing yards was with rushing yards before contact and rush attempts. Additionally, passing yards, pass attempts, and pass completions all had heavy correlations with each other. These correlations all made sense logically, and I expected most of them.

In the future, it would be interesting to take the players stats analysis and see how it impacted each of the games they played it. You could use this comparison to identiy trends between certain rushing, passing, or recieving stats and whether or not the team won, which could be very useful for offensive coaches.
